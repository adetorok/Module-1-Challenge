This is my Module-1-Challenge homework 

Answers to the Homework questions Below.

QUESTION 1 Draws three conclusions from the data.
1. Based on the available data, it appears that journalism projects have the smallest presence on the platform, with only four projects listed. However, all of these projects have been successful. This could indicate that there is a limited demand for journalism projects on this platform, or that fewer attempts are being made to launch such projects.
2. Based on the available data, it appears that theater is the most profitable category on the platform. Out of a total of 344 projects, 187 have been successful. This indicates that theater projects have a higher likelihood of success compared to other categories.
3. The technology category has a high failure rate despite not having the highest number of total projects. It has 28 failed projects, which is second only to the theater, which has 132 failed projects. However, the theater has many more projects in total, indicating that technology projects have a relatively high risk of failure.

QUESTION 2 States limitations of the dataset for the Bar Chart?

There are blank spaces in the dataset (e.g., for 'food' and 'live'), which might represent zero or unrecorded data. This ambiguity can affect the analysis.

Some projects could fit into multiple categories (e.g., a documentary about food), and the dataset does not clarify how such overlaps are handled.

The dataset lacks qualitative data about the projects, such as project descriptions or reasons for failure. This information could provide deeper insights into the success or failure rates.

QUESTION 3 Suggestions for Additional Tables or Graphs?

A clearer comparison of performance across categories could be achieved by presenting a graph of success rates (successful projects divided by total projects) for each category. 

Showing the average project duration (from launch to end date) by outcome can reveal if there's a correlation between project length and success rate.

In order to gain insights into the common pitfalls that lead to project failure, it would be valuable to collect data on the reasons behind such failures and categorize them in a table format. Such an approach could provide a basis for enhancing the understanding of factors that contribute to project failures and assist in developing strategies to avoid these obstacles in the future.

QUESTION 4 Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data?

In this case, the median (201) is significantly lower than the mean (851), which suggests that the data is skewed to the right. This happens when there are outlier values that pull the mean higher. Given this, the median is probably a better summary of the central tendency for this dataset, as it is less sensitive to skewed distribution and the presence of outliers.

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
Variance and standard deviation are used to determine the variability of a dataset, indicating how spread out the numbers are. A higher variance and standard deviation mean that the data is more spread out. In order to compare the variability of successful and unsuccessful campaigns, we need to have the variance or standard deviation from the sets of data. However, since we only have this set of statistics, it is not possible to compare the two types of campaigns directly.

The variance and standard deviation provided are high, indicating that there is significant variability in your dataset. This variability could be explained by the fact that successful campaigns can differ greatly in the amount of support they receive, ranging from very few to many backers. Such variability is plausible since some campaigns may only meet their goals, while others may exceed them by a large margin, resulting in a wide range of backer counts.

To summarize the central tendency of the data, the median may be a better option than the mean, as the mean can show skewness due to the discrepancy between the two. If we want to compare the variability between successful and unsuccessful campaigns, we would need similar descriptive statistics for both groups. The high variability in the dataset can be explained by the nature of campaign success, which can vary significantly.
